# LLMAN SDD Specs Compact

Use this skill to compact specs without changing normative behavior.

## Pipeline Position

    style compact fill:#e8f4e8,stroke:#28a745,stroke-width:2px
```

> 📎 Maintenance tool, typically run after accumulating many archives. For daily development → `llman-sdd-propose` / `llman-sdd-apply`.

## Context
- Specs grow bloated with duplicate requirements/scenarios as changes accumulate.
- Compaction must remain verifiable and regressible.
- When archive history is too large, it interferes with compaction review and navigation.

## Goal
- Identify and merge redundant requirements/scenarios.
- Form a more compact and maintainable spec structure.

## Constraints
- Don't delete normative behavior without explicit replacement.
- Try to keep requirement titles stable.
- Each retained requirement must have at least one valid scenario.

## Workflow
1. Inventory current specs (`llman sdd list --specs`).
2. If archived history is large, run archive freeze first:
   - Preview: `llman sdd archive freeze --dry-run`
   - Execute: `llman sdd archive freeze --before <YYYY-MM-DD> --keep-recent <N>`
3. Identify overlapping items across capabilities.
4. Produce a compaction plan (canonical requirements + keep/merge/remove decisions + migration notes).
5. Execute and validate (`llman sdd validate --specs --strict --no-interactive`).

## Decision Policy
- Prefer merging when two requirements are semantically equivalent.
- Only extract shared spec text when reference relationships are clear.
- When archive directory is noisy, suggest freezing first before compacting.
- If compaction would change external behavior, pause and ask the user first.

## Output Contract
- Output compaction plan grouped by capability.
- Include: keep/merge/remove decisions with rationale.
- Include validation commands and expected results.

> 💡 After maintenance, new work goes through the normal pipeline: `llman-sdd-propose` → `llman-sdd-apply` → `llman-sdd-verify` → `llman-sdd-archive`.

Before acting, read `llmanspec/config.yaml` and follow its `context` and `rules` if present.

Common commands:
- `llman sdd context --task "<description>" --paths "<files>"` (find relevant specs). Uses the pageindex agentic tree backend (needs `LLMAN_SDD_INDEX_CHAT_MODEL`). Preset via `LLMAN_SDD_INDEX_BACKEND`.
- `llman sdd list` (list changes)
- `llman sdd list --specs` (list specs with purpose/scope metadata)
- `llman sdd show <id>` (show change/spec)
- `llman sdd validate <id>` (validate a change or spec)
- `llman sdd validate --all` (bulk validate)
- `llman sdd index rebuild` (rebuild the pageindex tree index — no model needed)
- `llman sdd index check` (check index freshness)
- `llman sdd change new <id>` (create draft `changes/<id>/proposal.md`)


- `llman sdd change delta …` (BDD-off only: TOON delta authoring; rejected when BDD-on)

- `llman sdd change archive <id>` (seal a change; BDD-on: docs only after checkpoint / finalize fallback; BDD-off: merge TOON deltas)
- `llman sdd archive freeze [--before YYYY-MM-DD] [--keep-recent N] [--dry-run]` (freeze archived dirs)
- `llman sdd archive thaw [--change <id> ...] [--dest <path>]` (restore from cold-backup)
- `llman sdd graph [CHANGE] [--format mermaid] [--scope active|archived|all] [--depth N]` (generate change dependency graph)
- `llman sdd project migrate [--kind format|partitioned|legacy-bdd|auto]` (one-shot migrations)

Validation fixes (TOON standalone specs):

1) Missing validation scope (`Spec valid_scope must not be empty`):
Main specs MUST carry a non-empty `valid_scope` inside the `.toon` document.
`llmanspec/specs/<feature-id>/spec.toon`:
```toon
kind: llman.sdd.spec
name: sample
purpose: "One-line overview."
valid_scope[1]: src
requirements[1]{req_id,title,statement}:
  r1,Title,System MUST do something.
scenarios[1]{req_id,id,given,when,then}:
  r1,happy,"",a trigger happens,the outcome is observed
```

2) No delta ops in a change: add at least one op + scenario in
`llmanspec/changes/<change-id>/specs/<feature-id>/spec.toon`:
```toon
kind: llman.sdd.delta
ops[1]{op,req_id,title,statement,from,to,name}:
  add_requirement,r1,Title,System MUST do something.,null,null,null
op_scenarios[1]{req_id,id,given,when,then}:
  r1,happy,"",a trigger happens,the outcome is observed
```

3) Tabular value quoting error ("Expected N tabular row values, but got M"):
Values containing **spaces**, commas, colons, or brackets MUST be double-quoted in tabular rows.
```toon
# BAD: spaces in an unquoted value split it into multiple values
r1,happy,"",a trigger happens,the outcome is observed

# GOOD: multi-word values quoted
r1,happy,"","a trigger happens","the outcome is observed"
```

4) BDD-on guardrail (Git-native Partitioned SSOT):
When `config.yaml` has `bdd:`: `spec.toon` = constraints / non-executable scenarios; `*.feature` = executable GWT (`@req`). Edit live files on a non-default branch → `change attach` → prefer `change finalize` (single commit) or fallback `checkpoint` → docs-only `change archive` → Git merge. Do not hunt for solidify, and do not create `*.feature.delta.toon` (if one already exists it is a migration blocker — run `project migrate --kind partitioned`). Empty requirements with no `.feature` = ERROR.

Notes:
- Each spec is a single standalone `.toon` file; there is no Markdown shell or ```toon fence.
- `null` represents missing optional fields.
- Migrate legacy `.md`+fence specs with `llman sdd migrate`.

## Context
- Gather the current change/spec state before acting.
- Prefer `llman sdd context --task --paths` to discover relevant specs instead of guessing or full scans.

## Goal
- State the concrete outcome for this command/skill execution.

## Constraints
- Keep changes minimal and scoped.
- Avoid guessing when identifiers or intent are ambiguous.
- Use `llman sdd context --task --paths` before reading full spec files.
- Choose workflow path based on change scale: behavioral contract changes use full SDD, implementation changes use quick path.

## Workflow
- Use `llman sdd` commands as the source of truth.
- Validate outcomes when files or specs are updated.
- Prefer `llman sdd context` over full reads or guessing.
- When context is unavailable follow error guidance (rebuild index or fall back to `list --specs --json`).

## Decision Policy
- Ask for clarification when a high-impact ambiguity remains.
- Stop instead of forcing through known validation errors.

## Output Contract
- Summarize actions taken.
- Provide resulting paths and validation status.

## Ethics Governance
- `ethics.risk_level`: classify risk as `low|medium|high|critical`.
- `ethics.prohibited_actions`: list actions that MUST NOT be performed.
- `ethics.required_evidence`: list required evidence before high-impact output.
- `ethics.refusal_contract`: define when to refuse and safe alternative response.
- `ethics.escalation_policy`: define when to escalate to user confirmation/review.
